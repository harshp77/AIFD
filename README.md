# üìç Overview 

![AI in Fault Diagnosis](https://github.com/harshp77/AIFD/assets/76607486/3552caed-8753-4e25-8699-f81da95f6c10.png)

In the world of industrial operations, reliability is paramount. Coal-fired power plants are no exception, and their efficiency and safety heavily depend on the well-being of their steam turbines. Turbine vibrations can spell disaster if left unchecked, as they are a leading cause of unplanned shutdowns. In such a critical environment, having a quick and dependable fault diagnosis system for steam turbines is not a luxury; it's a necessity.

### The Challenge

Steam turbine health is influenced by a myriad of factors, and detecting subtle faults in the blades can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Traditional monitoring methods are often limited in their ability to detect early signs of turbine blade faults. This is where our project, "AI in Fault Diagnosis," comes into play.

### Leveraging Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Our project harnesses the power of Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to monitor and diagnose unnoticed faults in turbine blades. By leveraging supervised learning methods and historical data from distributed control systems (DCS), we've created a system that can reliably identify and categorize potential or existing faults. This allows for precise determination of safety measures and preemptive action to prevent unexpected breakdowns.

### A Deep Learning Approach

At the heart of our solution is a Deep Learning model with meticulously optimized parameters. This model excels at classifying incoming data as faulty and predicting the remaining time before maintenance becomes necessary. Our multilayer network has been carefully trained to uncover the intrinsic connections between all input variables.

### Impressive Results

Our approach boasts a fault detection accuracy of 96% for turbine blade faults and machine health prediction with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of just 0.02334. These results outperform existing methods in real-time scenarios.

### Real-World Testing

To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted tests using operational data from a coal-powered plant in India. The results were conclusive: our system can reliably detect turbine flaws in a coal-powered plant and provide timely warnings. This empowers operators to proactively identify possible faults and schedule maintenance before a minor issue escalates into a major problem.
